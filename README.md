# Business Site

The assignment this time has been to build a business site with an accordion and a sign-up form.

## The problem

I encountered issues with aligning the sign-up for and accordion like I wanted them to be, as well as some issues regarding an image. I mostly worked on it in the weekend, but next time I want to make a sure to get most of the things done during the week when there is more help to get, if possible.
