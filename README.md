# Business Site

The assignment this time has been to build a business site with an accordion and a sign-up form.

## The problem

I encountered issues with aligning the sign-up for and accordion like I wanted them to be, as well as some issues regarding an image. I mostly worked on it in the weekend, but next time I want to make a sure to get most of the things done during the week when there is more help to get, if possible.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
